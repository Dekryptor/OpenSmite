# OpenSmite
Very simple external cheat for **League of Legends**  
Currently it's updated for patch **7.13**, it will not work on different game versions. (Addresses will change)  

## Remarks
* I did not bother with LoL AntiCheat, use at your own risk.  
* It only smites highlighted target, so you need to hold your mouse above the target.  
* ~~By default the hotkey for AutoSmite is the 'X' key, feel free to change that in code yourself.~~  
* Click D/F, hold mouse above the target. The cheat will release Smite key when it can kill the target.
* Requires Quick Cast with indicators.
