# OpenSmite
Very simple external cheat for **League of Legends**  
Currently it's updated for patch **7.12**, it will not work on different game versions. (Addresses will change)  

## Remarks
* I did not bother with LoL AntiCheat, use at your own risk.  
* You obviously need a smite as your summoner, it needs to be off cooldown, when you press the hotkey.  
* It only smites highlighted target, so you need to hold your mouse above the target.  
* By default the hotkey for AutoSmite is the 'X' key, feel free to change that in code yourself.
